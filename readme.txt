Well hello

Test based on example submitted page, I have deployed this project in a domain 
that I had unused to view the project online.

You can visit the project at http://ciudadcentralbogota.com/

It is made with html5, CSS some boostrap icons and layout with flexBox
The methodology that followed for the styles is BEM methodologist.

And all the tags follow a chronological and intuitive order so,
that the code can be easily read.

I have used an additional stylesheet to normalize, the layout in the different browsers.

The units of measurement that I have used are "em", so that the project was responsive, too

I hope I have met expectations, and i would like to have more time to finish the chat, and obviously am always willing to hear suggestions for improvement,

thanks for reading this lines,
best regards Jaime Sanchez Galvis
